- `git checkout remix_beta`
- `git pull origin remix_beta`

- `git push -f origin remix_beta`

## Testing

Testing is performed after the Feature Freeze on `remix-beta.ethereum.org`. `build-qa-doc.js` script can be used to generate the list of QA tasks. Instructions to use the file are given in the file itself : https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/blob/master/build-qa-doc.js#L18 .

Once ready to run, it can be run using the Node.js: `node build-qa-doc.js`

## remixd NPM release

Once testing is completed, release will start by publishing `remixd`.if required, `remixd` can be also released individually

- Bump version for remixd in `./libs/remixd/package.json`
- Run: `nx build remixd`
- Move to build directory: `cd ./dist/libs/remixd`
- Publish to NPM: `npm publish` (Make sure you are logged in to NPM)
- create bump PR to master

## Remix libraries NPM release

- Make sure you are on latest `master` branch
- `git pull origin master`
- `git checkout -b bumpLibsVersion`
- `yarn run publish:libs `

This command uses `lerna` and is solely responsible for publishing all the remix libraries. It will ask for a new version of each library. Make sure you are logged in to NPM.

Once this command has been run, the versions for each remix library will be updated to latest in the libs' package.json file.
